# Automatic-control-with-movement-sense

Implemented a system that detects motion and sends commands to the user PC to automate actions on pc
	which user desires. Used ARM assembly language to program the server for efficient and fast response 
	time. The edge device is integrated with vibration sensors and a microcontroller.

Abstract :- The project aims to create a system which will notify you when there is disturbance
around it. This is can be used in many ways like if you want to know if some one entered your
house then you place this system near the door to get notified. It uses a vibration sensor along
with a microcontroller to comunicate with you via the internet,any vibraion sensed by the device
it will be notified to you. Anyone one in a need of monitoring their surroundings can use this. 

Introduction :
Often people are not aware about their surroundings. Some times people forget to close
their house doors. Some times they have busy work to do in their room but same time they
should keep a watch on something for for some reason. A device can be made such that you can
concentrate on your own work and only focus on the watch when the device tells you that
something is happening. This is device can be helpfull for all ages and can be made easily.
